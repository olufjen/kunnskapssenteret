#      username:password:options

# A basic entry consists of a username and password, such as
#
#      someuser:somepass
#
# To create an administrative user, place :admin after the password.
# For example, the following line would create a username of rdoe with
# a password of keepsafe that has administrative access to the EZproxy server.
#
#      rdoe:keepsafe:admin

admin:password:admin
